'''There is a classic algorithm in number theory that I thought can be a great addition to this Maths subdirectory: The 'Sieve of Eratosthenes'. 
It's an efficient way to find all prime numbers up to a given limit.

  Finds all prime numbers up to a given number n using the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

  This algorithm efficiently determines all primes less than or equal to n by iteratively marking multiples of primes as non-prime.

  Args:
    n: The upper limit for finding prime numbers (inclusive).

  Returns:
    A list containing all the prime numbers less than or equal to n.
